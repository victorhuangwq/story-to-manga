# Story to Manga Machine

Transform written stories into stunning visual manga or comic book pages using AI.

## What it does
Story to Manga converts text stories into visual manga or comic book pages. Users write a story, choose a style (Japanese manga or American comic), and the AI generates consistent character designs and comic panels.

## Features
- Multi-style generation (Japanese manga or American comic book styles)
- Import stories directly from Reddit URLs
- Character consistency through AI-generated reference sheets
- Progressive display showing generation process
- Shareable social media images
- Download individual panels or complete comic pages
- Smart story processing and character identification

## How to use
1. Visit https://app.storytomanga.com
2. Choose your preferred style (Manga or Comic)
3. Paste your story (max 500 words)
4. Watch the AI generate character designs and panels
5. Download or share your finished manga

## Best practices
Stories work best when they are 200-500 words with clear character descriptions, focused plots, and dialogue-heavy scenes. Complex plots with many characters may not generate as well.
